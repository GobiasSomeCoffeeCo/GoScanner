# GoScanner

A poor mans port scanner written in go 

# Why?
- [x] To help learn go
- [x] Try and build something "somewhat" functional from the command line :shrug:
- [ ] To not suck so much

# Would you like to install and tell me how to do better?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GobiasSomeCoffeeCo/goscanner.git
```
